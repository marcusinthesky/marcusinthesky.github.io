# Architecture

## Boundaries

The repository has one deployable application and two reusable TypeScript packages. `ui` owns visual semantics and contains no profile data. `content` owns public facts and contains no Next.js routing. The web app combines them and owns SEO, feeds, JSON-LD, and deployment concerns.

The public CV deliberately remains LaTeX-first. Its HTML representation is a curated projection because parsing template-specific LaTeX into a durable web schema would create more fragile tooling than it removes. Reviewers update the typed projection and LaTeX source together.

## Tool responsibilities

| Tool | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| devenv | Pinned system and language tools |
| just | Human-facing commands |
| Bun | JavaScript runtime and package manager |
| Turbo | TypeScript workspace task graph |
| prek | Repository-wide Git quality gates |
| Next.js | Static HTML application and metadata |
| Fumadocs MDX | Typed future local writing collections |
| Tectonic | Reproducible public CV PDF |

## Performance model

Remote services are publishing inputs, not page-load dependencies. All routes export as files, system fonts avoid font downloads, content pages contain no authored client JavaScript, and optional heavy capabilities such as browser Python, TTS, search, and video platforms are deferred until real content requires them.
